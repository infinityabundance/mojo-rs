# WORKLOG

Session log for the mojo-rs implementation. Each entry follows the reporting
discipline of the master directive (§17): implemented, files changed, claims,
courts run, counts, residuals, mismatches, root causes, unsupported behavior,
next gate.

## Cycle 2026-08-04 — Phase 0: cartography and oracle establishment

### 1. What was actually implemented

* Repository scaffold, workspace, and storage/daemon infrastructure per the
  addendum: isolated project Docker daemon rooted at the host-specific
  `MOJO_RS_DOCKER_ROOT` (`/run/media/one/1tb_kingston1/docker/mojo-rs`).
* Chromium epoch-1 pin: tag `151.0.7922.105` (commit
  `bfa3579138998e2fbb981725570fa588c5b6f8cd`), verified against
  chromium.googlesource and chromiumdash.
* Environment resolution (precedence CLI > env > local file > portable
  defaults), daemon lifecycle, Ubuntu image selection, storage verification,
  oracle source fetch, environment receipts.
* Casefile schema v1, court manifests, atlas structure.

### 2. Which files changed

See `git log --stat` for the cycle.

### 3. Compatibility claims now supported

None yet (correctly): the project is at `Scaffolded`/`Parsed` only.

### 4. Which courts were run

None yet. The first runnable court is the wire differential court (Phase 1).

### 5. Exact pass/fail counts

n/a.

### 6. New residuals and evidence paths

n/a.

### 7. Every observed mismatch

n/a.

### 8. Root cause of each fixed mismatch

n/a.

### 9. Remaining unsupported behavior

Everything behavioral.

### 10. Next highest-value parity gate

Pin + fetch the oracle source; build the official Mojo oracle (libmojo_core +
driver); seal the first wire differential fixtures; then the message-pipe slice.
